<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/tasks/abc189_c">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>In every subsegment it&rsquo;s optimal to choose maximum value of x as x has to be less than equal to every value in segment. Hence maximum value of x in a particular segment in the minimum value in that segment.</p>
<p>Now, we can simply fix L and keep increasing R and update minimum on the go.</p>
<h4 id="code1">code1</h4>
<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/submissions/19595957">Atcoder solution Link</a></p>
<p>We can also use sparse table and solve this problem in n*log(n)</p>

<p>We can also use O(n) stack method by visualizing this problem as finding the maximum area in a histogram.</p>

<h3 id="problem---d">Problem - D</h3>
<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/tasks/abc189_d">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a simple dp</p>
<p>dp[i][0] = be the number of ways to get false after ith steps</p>
<p>dp[i][1] = be the number of ways to get false after ith steps</p>
<h4 id="code-1">code</h4>
<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/submissions/19606017">Atcoder solution Link</a></p>
<p>We can also do</p>
<p>if current operation is AND then to get true here we need to have true before, ans[i] = ans[i-1]</p>
<p>current operation is OR then if we put 1 here than we can have anything before and if we put 0 here then we need to have 1 before, ans[i] = ans[i] + 2^n</p>
<h3 id="problem---e">Problem - E</h3>
<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/tasks/abc189_e">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>The way I did it that I created kind of linear equation:-</p>
<p>$ X_t^k $ be value of x-coordinate of kth point after t operations</p>
<p>$ X_t^k = Mx_t * x^k + Ax_t $</p>
<p>and similar for y coordinate.</p>
<p>$ Y_t^k = My_t * y^k + Ay_t $</p>
<p>Now, we could find Mx_t, Ax_t , etc after each operation then we are done.</p>
<p>We also need to maintain a variable S for each time stamp that tells do we need to swap x and y coordinates.</p>
<p>for Operation of type 1 :-  (Mx * x + Ax,My * y + Ay) &mdash;&gt; (My * y + Ay,-Mx * x - Ax)</p>
<pre><code>        we need to swap (x,y)
        Mx[i] = My[i-1];
        Ax[i] = Ay[i-1];

        My[i] = -1*Mx[i-1];
        Ay[i] = -1*Ax[i-1];
</code></pre>
<p>we can form similar transition for all 4 operations.</p>
<h4 id="code-2">code</h4>
<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/submissions/19639188">Atcoder solution Link</a></p>
<p>A better solution is to use transformation matrix.</p>
<p>For rotation:</p>
<p>[X'] = [0  1 0 ] [X] </br>
[Y'] = [-1 0 1 ] [Y] </br>
[1]  = [0  0 1 ] [1] </br></p>
<p>we can form transformation matrix for other opeartions too and then simply multipy these matrix.</p>
<h3 id="problem---f">Problem - F</h3>
<p><a href="https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc189/tasks/abc189_f">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first see if are in state s and future expectation number of moves are independent of how we got here.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s better to process in backward order</p>
<p>dp[i] = Expected number of moves require to reach n.</p>
<p>dp[n] = 0</p>
<p>dp[0] = ans</p>
<p>Now, Lets first solve a easier verison where m = 0 or there are not any special cells.</p>
<p>dp[i] = 1 + (dp[i+1] + dp[i+2] + &hellip; + dp[i+m])/m</p>
<p>Now, in orginal problem all special cell leads us to first cell.</p>
<p>means dp[A] = dp[0] where A is any special cell.</p>
<p>so dp[i] = 1 + (sum of dp values of normal cell + number of special cells * X)/m</p>
<p>where X = dp[0]</p>
<p>at last we can solve linear equation</p>
<p>dp[0] = X = 1 + (sum of dp values of normal cell + number of special cells * X)/m</p>

<p>This is a contruction problem.</p>
<p>My idea is basically on each day I will put fruits in only two plates.</p>
<pre><code>WLOG, Lets say we are on day i which is a perfect power of 2  
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>we have a plate with capacity 2*i full of (i-1) fruits corresponding to previous i-1 days. 

Let it be P1. 

And we also have a empty plate P2 of 4*i capacity.
</code></pre>
<p>Now for each day, j , from day [ i - 2*i ),</p>
<pre><code>- we will put 1 fruit of type 'j' in P1

- we will put 3 fruit, one of each type, which are not already present in P2.

- we will present P1 on each day
</code></pre>
<p>As we will have i days in between 2<em>i and i and each day we have capacity to put 3 fruits in P2, So for sure, by the end of 2</em>i th day, we would have added all 2*i fruits in P2.</p>
<p>Now For iteration from 2<em>i to 4</em>i,</p>
<pre><code>P2 &lt;--- P1 
we will have new empty plate with capacity 8*i as P2
</code></pre>
<p>Looks at implementation for better understanding.</p>

<p>Firstly, I thoght if ducks of any color, let N1 , is &gt;=k then its always better to fill $ N1/K $ boxes full of K ducks of one color. This claim is false as</p>
<p>For ex:</p>
<pre><code>N = 2, K = 5
ducks :- 7 1 2
</code></pre>
<p>According to the above approach, Box will be contain 5 ducks of color 0 and we are left with 2 1 2 ducks of respective colors and 1 box.</p>
<p>But one possible ans is
Box 1 : 0 4 1 1<br>
Box 2 : 0 3 2 2</p>
<p>Now, Its clicked my mind it&rsquo;s better to choose to color that has smallest number of ducks and combine that with the color with most number of ducks, This ways we will eleminate one color.</p>
<p>So we can first choose color with minimum number of ducks , Let it be N1 , and</p>
<pre><code>untill N1 &gt;= K but K ducks in one boxes
</code></pre>
<p>Now, We have N1 &lt; K</p>
<pre><code>Put all the ducks in a box along with ducks of color which has maximum number of ducks.
</code></pre>
<p>After 2nd step, maximum number of ducks may change so we need to maintain set to get color with maximum and minimum number of ducks</p>

   ^                              '         
   '----------------------------- '      

   bitCount(x1)!=bitCount(x3)
   bitCount(x2)!=bitCount(x4)
   and so on
</code></pre><p>So I made a single cycle of the form</p>
<pre><code>  b1 ---&gt; b1 ---&gt; b2 ----&gt; b2  ----&gt; b1 ----&gt; b1 ----&gt; b3 ----&gt; b3
   ^                                                             '
   '-------------------------------------------------------------'      

   bi is any number with 'i' set bits 
</code></pre><p>We need to take care of a case when last element has 1 bits.</p>
<p>Though, Editorial has a much better solution where after forming solution for K = 4 to 8 other solution can be exploited from there.</p>

<p>Problem A,B are quite simple</p>
<p>In problems like C, I guess it&rsquo;s better to thing something like how could I get rid of one color.
So, colors with less number of ducks create problems. we can club such a color with any other color. something like that</p>
<p>In problem like D, Its more of a inplementation problem. We can create ranges we in range</p>
<pre><code>[L,R]    we need to add 4, 8, 12, ..., 4*(R-L+1)
we can add 1 at each index from L to R and -4*(R-L+1) at R+1 now PF[i] is the required value
</code></pre>
<p>In problem F, Always try to solve problem for smaller values and then use results to form solution for bigger constrainsts. In questions dealing with bits, its may be possible that smaller results get multiplied by something.</p>

<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1465/problem/B">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>So Number should be divided by all digits in it.</p>
<p>whenevery anything need to be divided by each of number of a set, that thing must be divided by the LCM  of the whole set.</p>
<p>so there can be at max 1-9 digit.</p>
<pre><code>LCM[1,2,...,9] &lt; 2580
</code></pre>
<p>Hence, All multiples of 2580 will for sure satisfy the condition hence will be need at max 2579 iterations.</p>
<p>Hence we can do brute Force</p>

<p>So after going through a few examples, we can see that if we make edges between x &ndash;&gt; y for rook placed at (x,y) then</p>
<pre><code>1. for every rook (x,x) ans does not increment
2. for every rook (x,y) ,x!=y ans increment by 1
3. for every cycle in graph ans increasess by 1

<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1465/problem/D">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>if(x&gt;y) then it&rsquo;s always better to change 01 to 10</p>
<p>if(y&gt;x) then it&rsquo;s always better to change 10 to 01</p>
<p>Answer will be of the form</p>
<pre><code>if x&gt;y  111111s0000000s
if y&gt;x  000000s1111111s

         E-D-C+B+A,
         E-D-C+B-A,
</code></pre>
<p>We can observe that expect last 2 every one can be any sign + or -</p>
<p>Now, Left is we have list of numbers then  $ (\sum (+=2^{b[i]})) = Target $</p>
<p>If we are provided with many powers of 2, and we can select any set out of all power2 of 2 to form a target value. We can easily sove this problem by going from 0 to MSB and</p>
<pre><code>if cur bit(b) of tar is 1 then cnt[b]--
cnt[b+1]+=cnt[b]/2
</code></pre>
<p>But problem is, In this problem , either we choose with positive sign or with negative sign but we can not ignore.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<pre><code>+-2^{b[i]} = 2^{b[i]} - (0,2^{b[i]+1})
</code></pre>
<p>Using above transormation, we can change this problem to above problem.</p>

<p>As abs(A[i]-A[j]) == abs(A[j]-A[i]) and every ordered pair need to be counted hence array can be reordered as we wish.</p>
<p>So if we sort the array the we need to just
$$ \sum_{i=1}^n ( i*A[i] - \sum_{j=1}^iA[j])  $$</p>

<p>As this can also be written as

<p>let g  = gcd(A,K,N)</p>
<p>we can divide eq2 by g</p>
<pre><code>let K' = K/g , N' = N/g , A' = A/g

eq1 becomes K'*x = A' mod N'

<p>$K^{-1}$ be the multiplicative modulus of K' under N',</p>
<pre><code>multiply both side $K^{-1}$ it becomes

x = ($K^{-1}$*A')%N

<p>Now only thing left is to check if multiplicative modulus of K' exist or not.</p>
<p>$K^{-1}$ under N' exist if K' and N' are co-prime ( gcd(K],N')==1 )</p>
<p>if $K^{-1}$ exist then modified equation for sure has exactly one solution but original equations will have exactly g solutions , <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/linear_congruence_equation.html">see this</a> ,</p>

<p>It implies</p>
<pre><code>1. Total Health of all monster (A+B+C) has to be a multiple of 9

<h3 id="problem-b---find-the-array">Problem B :- Find The Array</h3>
<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1463/problem/B">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>Just by reading the problem we can get the intution that it will have a constructive solution.
By looking at the first test case I thought may be we can always form a solution containing a single element.</p>
<p>So I tried element a[0] and a[n-1] and check condition three given in Problem but its not the case.</p>
<p>Now, I am still struck on the idea that solutoin contain a single element so I tried to take any a[i] and tried to come up with some condition on basis of which I can choose &lsquo;i&rsquo; but its still wrong</p>
<p>I wasted quite a lot of time on this idea</p>
<p>Then I thought of making absolute difference between array &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;b&rsquo; as less as possible  implies making array &lsquo;b&rsquo; equals to &lsquo;a&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now only problem is to satisfy condition 2 which can be satisfied if every alternate element is 1</p>
<p>Hence Solution is</p>
<p><code>a[1] 1 a[3] 1 a[4] 1 ... </code></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><code>1 a[2] 1 a[4] 1 ...</code></p>

<h3 id="problem-3---busy-robot">Problem 3 :- Busy Robot</h3>
<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1463/problem/C">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>Now In this questions, First we can notice that it we can simulate the movement of robot and get which command is Good/Successfull. We can also store for each good command that during its execution it will move from X1 to X2.</p>
<p>I have a poor implementation that took me a lot of time penalty.</p>

<h3 id="problem-4---pairs">Problem 4 :- Pairs</h3>
<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1463/problem/D">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>In this problem, Let&rsquo;s say we represent the problem as</p>
<p><code>S = OXOXOXXOXOOX</code> where {  S[i] = &lsquo;X&rsquo;   -&gt; ith element is present</p>
<pre><code>                          S[i] = 'O'   -&gt; ith element is not present }
</code></pre>
<p>Now Lets try :-</p>
<pre><code>x=0, means we need to take maximum from each pair that is every 'X' must be paired with a previous 'O'

x=1, means we need to take minimum from exacty one pair that is ( one 'O' must be paired with a previous 'X'  + exactly n-1 'X' must be paired with a previous 'O'. 

x=2, means we need to take minimum from exacty 2 pair that is ( 2 'O' must be paired with a previous 'X'  + exactly n-2 'X' must be paired with a previous 'O'. 

x=n-1, means we need to take minimum from exacty n-1 pair that is ( n-1 'O' must be paired with a previous 'X'  + exactly 1 'X' must be paired with a previous 'O'.

x=n ,means we need to take minimum from exacty n pair that is ( n 'O' must be paired with a previous 'X'  + exactly 0 'X' must be paired with a previous 'O'.
</code></pre>
<p>Means maximum value of x will be the maximum &ldquo;OX&rdquo; subsequence that we can get</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>Means maximum value of n-x,meaning minimum of x, will be the maximum &ldquo;XO&rdquo; sub subsequence that we can get</p>
<pre><code>ans = Xmax-Xmin+1;

<h3 id="problem-5----plan-of-lectures">Problem 5 :-  Plan of Lectures</h3>
<p><a href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1463/problem/E">Problem Link</a></p>
<p>This Problem also looks more of a inplementation problem.</p>
<p>Taking care of requirement 1 is easy we just need to form a directed graph and find topological sorting
for requirement 2, if T1 is supposed to be followed by T2 then ordering T1,T2 is fixed, now suppose T2 is to be followed by T3 then ordering T1,T2,T3 is fixed means we will chains of fixed ordering.</p>
<p>so we can just compress these chain, then form graph based on prerequite, find topological sorting of graph and then decompress the nodes.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>I think I did A nicely.</p>
<p>I took to much time on B, I completed at 33rd min which is too bad, actually I got struck on one idea and wasted lot of time on it
I guess whenever sum/2 term comes we can think it in terms of Seven and Sodd or dividing sum in 2 groups. I should have looked at Sodd and Seven earlier.</p>
<p>I also took a bit more time to implement C.</p>
<p>I could not do D in contest, One thing to learn from this is whenever possible try to form Hotvector encoding and then think. Paranthesis should also be kelt in mind here. Also keep making cases and then think</p>
<p>During upsolving E looked easy to me and idea came quite easly to me. Though I took quite a lot of time to implement.</p>
