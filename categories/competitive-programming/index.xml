      <description>Problem - A Problem Link
Simply check if S[0]==S[1]==S[2]
Problem - B Problem Link
Simply keep calculating alcohol volume in your body and see when does it becomes strickly greater than x.
To avoid precision error use
X &amp;gt; (Y/100) &amp;lt;==&amp;gt; X*100 &amp;gt; Y  code Atcoder solution Link
Problem - C Problem Link
In every subsegment it&amp;rsquo;s optimal to choose maximum value of x as x has to be less than equal to every value in segment.</description>

      <description>Problem A - Bovine Dilemma Problem Link
Area of triangle is $ (1/2)* Base * Height $
Height is a constant 1
Only variable is Base Length which is X[j] - X[i].
So we can simply do a O(n^2) brute force.
Code Solution Link
Problem B - Last minute enhancements Problem Link
we can simply notice that
if
1) A[i] &amp;gt; A[i-1] ----&amp;gt; Then its never better to increase A[i] as neighter it does any good for ith index nor it will be any good for futher indexex 2) A[i] &amp;lt;= A[i-1] ----&amp;gt; Then its always good to increase A[i] to A[i]+1.</description>

      <description>Solutions Problem - Self-Destructing Strings Problem Link
As every deletion operation, deletes EXACTLY 2 character means parity of length of string does not change. Our objective is to make reduce string to empty string means to string of length of 0 which is even hence length of original string must also be even
Also, After going through few examples we can see, we need abs(cnt[0]-cnt[1])/2 operations.
But, There is one edge case :- when string contain only all same character then it is impossible to reduce it to empty string</description>
