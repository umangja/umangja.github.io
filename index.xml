      <description>Hey there, I am Umang Jain. I am not a geek who is interested in anything related to computers or science fiction.
After years of slogging and hardwork, I finally managed to get AIR 977 in JEE ADVANCE 2017 and gained admission to the Indian Institute of Technology, Varanasi (IIT BHU) and currently pursuing my Integrated Dual Degree (IDD) in the Computer Science and Engineering Department. I’m currently very excited to join at oracle on 7th May, 2021 as an Application Developor.</description>
